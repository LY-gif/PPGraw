# PPGraw

*PPGraw* is a Python tool developed for the analytical quality review of supposedly raw, unfiltered photoplethysmography signals, based on 7 multi-varied decision metrics.

### Contents
* **ref_sample.p** is a Python Pickle file containing a 3-minute excerpt of the raw, unfiltered PPG reference signal
* **PPGraw.py** contains the Python class of the analytical tool *PPGraw* for the automated quality review of raw photoplethysmography signals
* **show_ref.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook that visualizes the provided reference data
* **show_review.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook that runs the quality review on the reference data
