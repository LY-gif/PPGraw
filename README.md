## The Quest for Raw Signals:<br>A Quality Review of Publicly Available Photoplethysmography Datasets

### Description
We have presented an analytical tool for the quality review of 10 publicly available photoplethysmography (PPG) datasets, based on 7 multi-varied decision metrics. Although all datasets were advertised to contain raw signals, the characteristics of the PPG data look quite diverse. Our developed tool enables to automatically analyze the suitability and applicability of datasets and helps to identify preprocessed and filtered signals with a limited evidence. The raw reference data, recorded with the MAX86140EVSYS# evaluation system, as well as the implemented Python tool, based on the presented 7 decision metrics, are available for download below, to support the reproducibility and the review of new datasets.

### Download
This GitHub repository provides the developed analytical tool.
